# Sublime Merge Integration

Sublime Merge is great, VS Code is great; together, they should also be great.

This extension aspires to switch you quickly to Sublime Merge for common Git tasks.

## Features

- `Sublime Merge: Blame` command: blame the active file/line.
- `Sublime Merge: File History (Log)` command: show the active file's history.

## Requirements

Sublime Merge + `smerge` CLI binding set up.

## Extension Settings

* todo: maybe a non-`smerge` CLI name?

## Known Issues

So young, so free. None yet.

## Release Notes

See the CHANGELOG.
